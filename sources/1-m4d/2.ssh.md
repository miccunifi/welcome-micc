# SSH

## Generate ssh-key

Generate private and public keys with

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

or

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

(choose the default configuration. It’s ok)

For more details, please look at here __<https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen>__


After that, add your key to each server with


```bash
ssh-copy-id <username>@<server-name>.micc.unifi.it
```

Add `-i <path/to/ssh/public/ssh/key>` if you assign a specif name to the keys.  That is:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i <path/to/ssh/public/ssh/key> <username>@<server-name>.micc.unifi.it
```


The keys (private and public) are stored in your home directory `~/.ssh/` unless you specified a different location during the configuration.


## Create ssh-key also on servers

Repeat the same procedure on the servers to generate the keys for pull/push your repos from github/gitlab.

Advice: You can use the same private/public keys for all the servers. Just copy your private/public key files in all your home folders, i.e. `~/.ssh`



:::warning
Please do not use always the same RSA keys. Just use the same for MICC dream machines for simplicity and to add the same ssh key to your github/gitlab/bitbucket account.

:::

To see how to add ssh key to github/gitlab account please go to

* GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>
* Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys> and copy and paste your public key

To copy your public key, just type in your terminal

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy and paste your results.
