# Account

## Create your MICC account

Each of us at MICC has an account that is composed by the first letter of your first name and  your surname.

To create your MICC account, please ask your advisor to create it for you `<https://micc-ldap.local/`.


For example: If you are **Mario Bianchi**, your MICC username will be **mbianchi**.


This account is available for **all** MICC services, such as Chat, Server, …

## Log to server

To log into one server, type this command:

```bash
ssh <username>@<server-name>.micc.unifi.it
```


If you have copied your ssh keys to the server, you can log without the need to insert your password associated with the LDAP user.

If it asks you the password, insert the one associated with your LDAP account.


After you logged in, you can control if you have the correct permissions with the command

```bash
id
```

the output sould be pretty similar to this                   ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Zd2TdT2RILRG2-zLvZwpc_GkZlQRbc6-WjRwPuxVFuOuGQ6TG1wmtOlL71WcetR3FO-gQ0tRDCznTw-J0cuDdFS88A5o_QVG3-YWrqGFXkh2j7o_iBPiLrPKuOddVG6MmhqEGaGf)

Please note that your `$HOME` folder has a quota of 100 GB, so you have the responsibility to take care of your available free space on the server
