# NAS

Each server has access to some NAS (__<https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Attached_Storage>__) that can be accessed through the following syntax:


```bash
cd /<NAS-name>/<username>
```


where the `<NAS-name>` is one of :

* equilibrium
* andromeda
* fishtank
* oblivion

With NAS you have additional storage. Please note that writing/reading data from/to NAS is slow. It is recommended to copy in the NAS checkpoints or backup data of your repos.


**!!PLEASE DO NOT STORE DATASETS IN THE PERSONAL FOLDER!!**

Every dataset that will be found in personal folder will be deleted.


You can store your datasets in one of the following folders:

```bash
 /<NAS-name>/DATASETS 
# or   
/<NAS-name>/datasets 
# or 
/home/DATASETS
```


## COMING SOON

The file which are not modified in the last 30 days will be automatically deleted from the `$HOME` directories in order to preserve the space in our folders in which are fast SSD.

:::




This is done to avoid multiple copies of data all around our servers.

 \n       Another advantage that you can have using NAS is that the personal folder in the NAS is shared across all the servers. So you will see the same data from two different machines.

For example, if you add a `foo` folder in the `/equilibrium/mbianchi` folder in the NAS when you are logged to targaryen, the folder `/equilibrium/mbianchi/foo` will exists also from the other servers.
