# MICC servers (Dream Machine)

Here at MICC we have several servers that can be used to train models. We refer to these servers as **dream machines**. Most of them has two NVIDIA 2080 with 12 GB of memory. The hostnames are the following:

* targaryen
* lannister
* nikita
* harlock
* theflash
* lechuck
* ultron (this is the only machine with different hardware)

> **note**: Ultron is the most powerful dream machine, as it has two 24GB RTX

In the following, we refer to one of these hostnames with <server-name>.

## SSH connection

In order to connect to the dream machines you need to setup a ssh connection.

### Generate ssh-key

Generate private and public keys with:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

or

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

(you can select the default configuration)

For more details, please see __<https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen>__.


### Send it to on of the admins

The admins will add your ssh key to the server. To do that, you need to send your public key to one of the admins. To do that, just type

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

and copy the output. Then send it to the admins by email.


## Access to server

Now, add your key to each server with:
```bash
ssh-copy-id <username>@<server-name>.micc.unifi.it
```

Add `-i <path/to/ssh/public/ssh/key>` if you want to assign a specific name to the keys.  That is:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i <path/to/ssh/public/ssh/key> <username>@<server-name>.micc.unifi.it
```


If you used the default configuration to generate the keys, they are stored in your home directory `~/.ssh/.


## Log to server

To log into one of the servers, use this command:

```bash
ssh <username>@<server-name>.micc.unifi.it
```

If you have copied your ssh keys to the server (as before), you can log in without the need to insert your password associated with the LDAP user.

If it asks you the password, question yourself about the step done before. In fact, you can only access with ssh-keys.


After you logged in, you can check if you have the correct permissions with the command:

```bash
id
```

the output sould be pretty similar to this:
```bash
> uid=XXXX(your_username) gid=XXXX(your_username) groups=XXXX(your_username), 999(docker), 10001(quota), 10003(micc)
```                   

Please note that your `$HOME` folder has a quota of 100 GB, so you have the responsibility to take care of your available free space on the server

## Create ssh-key also on servers

Repeat the same procedure on the servers to generate the keys for pull/push your repos from github/gitlab.

Advice: You can use the same private/public keys for all the servers. Just copy your private/public key files in all your home folders, i.e. `~/.ssh`

Please do not use always the same RSA keys. Just use the same for MICC dream machines for simplicity and to add the same ssh key to your github/gitlab/bitbucket account.


To see how to add ssh key to github/gitlab account please go to

* GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>
* Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys> and copy and paste your public key                   

To copy your public key, just type in your terminal

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy and paste your results.
