## Set Static IP on your machine
Your machine can be reached by out of the network. In order to do that, you need to set a static IP. There are two ways to do that: external IP and local IP.

### External IP

In order to configure static IP for your laptop/MICC workstation, do the following steps:


1. Check a free IPv4 from our gdrive sheet:
   (Tips: sort IP in ascending order to better see free ips)
2. set the static ipv4 you choose `150.217.35.xxx` subnet mask `255.255.255.248` or `/21` and gateway `150.217.35.1`
3. set DNS `192.168.1.1`
4. **disable** the flag “Use this connection only for resources on this network”

### Local IP

In order to configure static IP for your laptop/MICC workstation, do the following step


1. Check a free IPv4 from our gdrive sheet:

   (Tips: sort IP in ascending order to better see free ips)
