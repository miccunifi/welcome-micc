# NAS

Each server has access to several NAS (__<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage>__). A NAS provides additional storage, but writing/reading data can possibly be quite slow. It is recommended to use NAS to store model checkpoints, backups and datasets.


Each NAS can be accessed from every dream machine with:

```bash
cd /<NAS-name>/<username>
```

where the `<NAS-name>` is one of:

* equilibrium
* andromeda
* fishtank
* oblivion


**!! DO NOT STORE DATASETS IN YOUR PERSONAL FOLDER !!**

Quite often multiple people use the same datasets for their research. To avoid wasting storage space with multiple copies of the same datasets, the datasets **must** be downloaded into the following folders:

```bash
 /<NAS-name>/DATASETS 
# or   
/<NAS-name>/datasets 
# or 
/home/DATASETS
```

Datasets located in personal folders will be deleted.


<!-- ## COMING SOON

The file which are not modified in the last 30 days will be automatically deleted from the `$HOME` directories in order to preserve the space in our folders in which are fast SSD.

This is done to avoid multiple copies of data all around our servers.

> Another advantage that you can have using NAS is that the personal folder in the NAS is shared across all the servers. So you will see the same data from two different machines.

> For example, if you add a `foo` folder in the `/equilibrium/mbianchi` folder in the NAS when you are logged to targaryen, the folder `/equilibrium/mbianchi/foo` will exists also from the other servers. -->
